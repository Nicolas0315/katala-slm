Katala SLM is a Rust-first medical-domain small language model framework with a KS verification layer.

## Scope and limits — read before using any output

**This is a research framework. It is not clinical decision support and must not be
used to make decisions about a patient.**

The KS verification layer *labels* output. It does not gate it:

- `verify()` returns the model's answer unchanged. A detected contraindication is
  attached as a field; it does not suppress, alter, or block the answer.
- Contraindication detection is **three illustrative keyword rules**
  (pregnancy/isotretinoin, anticoagulant/NSAID, renal/metformin). It is a
  demonstration of where such a check would sit, not a drug-interaction database.
  Any phrasing that avoids those literal words produces an empty contraindication
  list — that means "not checked", never "safe".
- `confidence` and `evidence_level` are scores over retrieved evidence. A low score
  reduces a number in the response; it does not stop the response.

If you are building on this, the gating decision is yours to add and yours to own.
The response carries `clinical_use: false` so that choice cannot be made by accident.

## Verified baseline — 2026-08-28

`cargo fmt --check`, workspace check, strict clippy, and all 56 tests pass. Continual-learning regressions without automatic rollback now return `NeedsReview`; they are no longer reported as success.

The useful KS lineage here is axis separation and explicit review state. Historical solver-majority or evidence-free promotion is intentionally not part of this repository.


## Features
- Decoder-only transformer core (GQA attention + RoPE + SwiGLU + RMSNorm)
- Candle-based forward pass and inference loop
- KS verification pipeline with:
  - Evidence-level classifier (`A/B/C/D`)
  - Confidence scoring (`0.0-1.0`)
  - Source attribution
  - Contraindication checks
- Axum REST API with structured medical output
- CLI modes for local inference and API serving

## Architecture Overview
- `src/model`: model configuration and transformer components
- `src/inference`: generation engine, KV cache, sampling
- `src/ks`: evidence classification, confidence, attribution, verification
- `src/data`: tokenizer wrapper and dataset abstractions
- `src/serve`: HTTP server and endpoints

## Build
```bash
# CPU
cargo build --release

# CUDA
cargo build --release --features cuda
```

## Usage
```bash
# Inference CLI
cargo run --release -- infer --prompt "Influenza treatment options?"

# API server
cargo run --release -- serve --port 8080
```

### API Request
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/medical/generate \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"prompt":"What is first-line treatment for influenza?"}'
```

### API Response
